# StringSpace
Implement a parseByStream function, which takes a string and a CHARACTER delimiter and splits the string by the delimiter utilizing std::istringstream.

Use a loop to iterate through the tokens and display each one. No need to store the tokens.

This method should only work with CHARACTER delimiters

Implement a parseByStrFunct function, which takes a string and a STRING delimiter and splits the string by the delimiter utilizing only string functions (no streams) such as string::find and string::substr. 

Use a loop to iterate through the tokens and display each one. No need to store the tokens.

This method should work with STRING delimiters which includes single character strings
